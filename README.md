Decentralized AI Final Project

The final assignment is to build a decentralized social network using the technologies we have learned about of the past couple of weeks. It can be the simplest dapp ever (just user accounts that can post to a single feed) but crucially you must submit a white paper with your assignment. Some help with that here: https://agentestudio.com/blog/10-best-ico-white-paper-examples-structure-and-design

The technology stack:

Node.JS
Truffle
Solidity
Ganache-cli (unless you utilize one of the testnets')
Cosmos? SingularityNET? OpenMined? Get creative!
IPFS
Whisper
